What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git sets up hidden files and preps the directory to be a repository
you need to do an initial commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area is a temporary place to start changes to your respository. the value is you can reason out what changes you are going to make and see them before you actually make them.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

by adding each file in the commit you can verify that you're make a sane and reasonable commit. If you have to search and think hard about all of the files that have changed then your scope may be too broad.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

if you're implementing a radical change or an experimental feature you can branch off the code and work without messing up the master branch. Branches allow you to have multiple versions of similar code, maybe one branch for one GUI another branch for a different GUI.
