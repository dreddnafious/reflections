What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git sets up hidden files and preps the directory to be a repository
you need to do an initial commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area is a temporary place to start changes to your respository. the value is you can reason out what changes you are going to make and see them before you actually make them.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

by adding each file in the commit you can verify that you're make a sane and reasonable commit. If you have to search and think hard about all of the files that have changed then your scope may be too broad.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

if you're implementing a radical change or an experimental feature you can branch off the code and work without messing up the master branch. Branches allow you to have multiple versions of similar code, maybe one branch for one GUI another branch for a different GUI.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

it helps you mostly by understanding that various branches have nodes that are unreachable, and the code in that branch make not reflect all of the code in the other branches.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

it merges as best as it can the two branches and makes them in to one branch. it is represented that way because it accurately reflects what's happening. two branches of a tree become one branch after all differences are resolved.
